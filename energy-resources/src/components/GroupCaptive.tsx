            Group Captive Open Access Solution is a clean energy project
            developed for the collective usage by a group of corporate and
            industrial (C&I) electricity buyers. As per the government
            regulation, the group of buyers will hold 26% equity. Together, all
            buyers collectively will need to consume at least 51% of the power â€“
            a PPA is drawn up to ensure clarity on electricity tariffs for 15-25
            years. The adoption of the Group Captive model is witnessing an
            increasing trend amongst corporates, because the savings per-unit
            electricity make it a compelling model. The capital investment is
            minimal, while per-unit tariffs are at least 25-40% cheaper than the
            grid.
            <br />
            <br />
            We aggregate multiple commercial and industrial (C&I) energy
            consumers by state and discom to form a community/group based on
            their collective demand - this will reduce the time taken to get the
            clean energy from group captive plants.
