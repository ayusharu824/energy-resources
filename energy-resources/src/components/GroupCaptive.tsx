              Group Captive Open Access Solution is a clean energy project developed
              for the collective usage by a group of corporate and industrial (C&I)
              electricity buyers. As per the government regulation, the group of
              buyers will hold 26% equity. Together, all buyers collectively will
              need to consume at least 51% of the power â€“ a PPA is drawn up to
              ensure clarity on electricity tariffs for 15-25 years. The adoption of
              the Group Captive model is witnessing an increasing trend amongst
              corporates, because the savings per-unit electricity make it a
              compelling model. The capital investment is minimal, while per-unit
              tariffs are at least 25-40% cheaper than the grid.
              <br />
              <br />
              We aggregate multiple commercial and industrial (C&I) energy consumers
              by state and discom to form a community/group based on their
              collective demand - this will reduce the time taken to get the clean
              energy from group captive plants.
